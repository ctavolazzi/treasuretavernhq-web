## Status: Completed
**Started:** 2025-06-16 16:45
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-16 17:45

## Objective
Update Node.js version requirements to resolve build failures in the CI/CD pipeline. The current build environment uses Node.js v18.17.1, but the project and its dependencies require ^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0.

## Tasks
1. [x] Review current Node.js version requirements in package.json
2. [x] Determine best approach (update build environment or adjust requirements)
3. [x] Update package.json if needed
4. [x] Test build process locally
5. [x] Document changes in devlog
6. [x] Fix accessibility issues found during build
7. [x] Fix unused exports and CSS issues
8. [x] Update ESLint dependencies to be compatible with Node.js v18.17.1

## Progress
- Identified Node.js version mismatch in build environment
- Current build environment: Node.js v18.17.1
- Required version: ^18.17.1 || ^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0
- Updated package.json to accept Node.js v18.17.1
- Verified wrangler.toml configuration is correct
- Fixed accessibility issues:
  - Added aria-label to clear search button in announcements page

  - Downgraded ESLint from v9.27.0 to v8.56.0
  - Updated related ESLint packages to compatible versions
  - Updated TypeScript ESLint packages to v7.0.0
- Successfully completed build with only non-critical CSS warnings
