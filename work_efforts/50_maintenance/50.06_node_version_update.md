## Objective
Update Node.js version requirements to resolve build failures in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Tasks
1. [x] Review current Node.js version requirements
2. [x] Fix accessibility issues
3. [x] Update ESLint dependencies to be compatible with Node.js v18.17.1
4. [ ] Complete final build test
5. [ ] Update documentation
6. [ ] Monitor CI/CD pipeline for successful builds

## Progress
- Identified Node.js version mismatch in build environment
- Current build environment using Node.js v18.17.1
- Required version: ^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0
- Fixed accessibility issues in newsletter page
- Removed unused data export
- Updated ESLint dependencies to be compatible with Node.js v18.17.1:
  - Downgraded ESLint from v8.55.0 to v8.40.0
  - Downgraded @typescript-eslint packages from v6.21.0 to v5.59.11
  - Downgraded eslint-config-prettier from v9.1.0 to v8.8.0
  - All ESLint-related packages now compatible with Node.js v18.17.1

## Next Steps
1. Test build with updated ESLint dependencies
2. Update documentation with new version requirements
3. Monitor CI/CD pipeline for successful builds

## Notes
- Build was failing due to Node.js version mismatch
- ESLint dependencies required higher Node.js version
- All accessibility and code quality issues have been addressed
- ESLint dependencies have been updated to be compatible with Node.js v18.17.1
