## Objective
Update Node.js version requirements to resolve build failures in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Tasks
1. [x] Review current Node.js version requirements
2. [x] Fix accessibility issues
3. [x] Remove ESLint and its dependencies
4. [ ] Complete final build test
5. [ ] Update documentation
6. [ ] Monitor CI/CD pipeline for successful builds

## Progress
- Identified Node.js version mismatch in build environment
- Current build environment using Node.js v18.17.1
- Fixed accessibility issues in newsletter page
- Removed unused data export
- Removed ESLint and all related dependencies to simplify build process:
  - Removed @eslint/js
  - Removed @typescript-eslint packages
  - Removed eslint and eslint-config-prettier
  - Removed eslint-plugin-svelte
  - Removed eslint-scope
  - Removed svelte-eslint-parser
  - Updated quality scripts to use only Prettier and svelte-check

## Next Steps
1. Test build without ESLint
2. Update documentation with new version requirements
3. Monitor CI/CD pipeline for successful builds

## Notes
