## Status: In Progress

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-16 17:50

## Objective
Update Node.js version requirements to resolve build failures in the CI/CD pipeline. The current build environment uses Node.js v18.17.1, but the project and its dependencies require ^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0.

## Tasks
1. [x] Review current Node.js version requirements in package.json
2. [x] Determine best approach (update build environment or adjust requirements)
3. [x] Update package.json if needed
4. [~] Test build process locally
5. [ ] Document changes in devlog
6. [x] Fix accessibility issues found during build
7. [x] Fix unused exports and CSS issues
8. [~] Update ESLint dependencies to be compatible with Node.js v18.17.1

## Progress
- Identified Node.js version mismatch in build environment
- Current build environment: Node.js v18.17.1
- Required version: ^18.17.1 || ^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0
- Updated package.json to accept Node.js v18.17.1
- Verified wrangler.toml configuration is correct
- Fixed accessibility issues:
  - Added aria-label to clear search button in announcements page
  - Added keyboard event handler to newsletter page link
  - Added role, tabindex, keyboard event handler, and aria-label to scroll arrow in newsletter page
- Fixed code quality issues:
  - Removed unused data export from newsletter page
  - Cleaned up unused CSS selectors
  - Simplified and modernized CSS styles
- Updated ESLint dependencies to be compatible with Node.js v18.17.1:
  - Downgraded ESLint from v9.27.0 to v8.56.0
  - Removed @types/eslint__js as it's not needed
  - Updated TypeScript ESLint packages to v7.0.0
  - Updated eslint-config-prettier to v9.1.0
  - Updated eslint-plugin-svelte to v2.35.1

## Next Steps
1. Test build with updated ESLint dependencies
2. Update documentation
3. Monitor CI/CD pipeline for successful builds

## Notes
- Build is failing in CI/CD pipeline due to Node.js version mismatch
- Wrangler.toml configuration is correct but was flagged in build logs
- Need to ensure compatibility with all development environments
- Updated Node.js version requirements to include v18.17.1 while maintaining support for newer versions
- All accessibility and code quality issues have been addressed
- ESLint dependencies have been updated to be compatible with Node.js v18.17.1
- Removed unnecessary @types/eslint__js dependency
