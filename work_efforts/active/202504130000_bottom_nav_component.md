# Dynamic Bottom Navigation Component

## üö© Objectives
- Create a dynamic, floating bottom navigation component that works on both desktop and mobile
- Make it fully modular and customizable per page
- Implement expandable interface with options menu
- Include music playback controls
- Ensure proper positioning with footer (prevent overlap)
- Support dynamic audio source changing
- Integrate with site layout to make it available across all pages
- Match the elegant design from the inspiration image

## üõ† Tasks
- [x] Create a reusable Svelte component for the bottom navigation
- [x] Implement the expandable interface with "+" button that transforms to "√ó" when expanded
- [x] Build the floating menu with speech bubble styling as seen in the mockup
- [x] Connect music controls to existing audio functionality
- [x] Make component customizable via props to allow different options on different pages
- [x] Implement footer detection to prevent overlap
- [x] Add support for dynamically changing audio sources
- [x] Create a store to manage audio settings between pages
- [x] Integrate the component into the main layout
- [x] Improve design to match the elegant style in the inspiration image
- [ ] Test across different devices and screen sizes

## üìù Notes
- The component should float at the bottom center of the viewport as a golden "+" button
- When expanded, it should show a speech bubble menu with a pointer directed at the button
- Music controls should appear at the top of the expanded menu
- Additional options should be customizable via props
- When scrolling to the bottom of the page, the nav should detect the footer and adjust position
- Design should match the site's fantasy theme with gold accents on dark background
- Audio sources should be changeable reactively through props
- Pages can set their own custom audio via the audioStore

## üêû Issues to Watch For
- Potential overlap with footer content when scrolling to bottom of page
- Mobile responsiveness challenges
- Browser compatibility with position: fixed elements
- Touch interaction differences between desktop and mobile
- Audio playback restrictions in different browsers
- Multiple audio players playing at the same time (page audio vs bottom nav audio)

## ‚úÖ Implementation Details
- Created a new `BottomNav.svelte` component in the components directory
- Added props for customization:
  - `navOptions`: Array of options with label, href, and optional action function
  - `enableMusicControl`: Boolean to toggle music controls visibility
  - `audioSrc`: Path to the audio file
  - `audioTitle`: Title for the music player
- Implemented smart footer detection to prevent overlap:
  - Uses scroll event listener to detect when footer is visible
  - Adjusts bottom position accordingly to avoid covering footer content
- Added animation for smooth menu expansion
- Enhanced the design to better match the inspiration image:
  - Centered the button at the bottom of the screen
  - Improved speech bubble appearance with pointer at center bottom
  - Enhanced styling with better shadows and transitions
  - Used more elegant spacing and font sizes
  - Added subtle dividers between menu options
- Created a demo page at `/bottom-nav-demo` to showcase the component
- Enhanced audio functionality:
  - Added support for dynamically changing audio sources
  - Implemented reactivity to detect changes to audioSrc prop
  - Maintained playback state when switching audio sources
  - Added proper cleanup of audio resources
- Created an audio store for page-specific audio settings:
  - Implemented `setPageAudio()` to allow pages to set custom audio
  - Added `resetPageAudio()` to restore default audio when leaving a page
  - Created `disablePageAudio()` to allow pages to hide the bottom nav
- Integrated the component into the main layout:
  - Added conditional rendering based on audio store state
  - Set up default navigation options
