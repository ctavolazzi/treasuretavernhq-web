# Work Effort: Create Markdown Content System with WebP Images

**Goal:** Create a flexible Markdown content system for the site that can render content from .md files with proper styling and image support.

**Requirements:**

1. Install necessary dependencies for Markdown parsing and frontmatter extraction.
2. Create a test Markdown page that supports images, formatting, and styled content.
3. Create a template example using "The Bone Kingdom" tale to demonstrate the system's capabilities.
4. Ensure proper styling that matches the mystical Treasure Tavern aesthetic.
5. Set up a system that could be extended to other content types across the site.
6. Create mystical styling for code blocks that fits the fantasy theme.

**Development Plan:**

* [x] Install Markdown parsing dependencies (marked, gray-matter)
* [x] Create test Markdown file with sample content and image references
* [x] Build route handler to parse Markdown and frontmatter
* [x] Create Svelte component to display processed content
* [x] Style the Markdown content to match Treasure Tavern's mystical aesthetic
* [x] Create Bone Kingdom example using proper Markdown
* [x] Update page to support querying different content files
* [x] Enhance code block styling to look like arcane invocations
* [ ] Consider extending pattern to announcements and other site content
* [ ] Update external content loading for tavern tales to use similar pattern

*Self-Correction/Refinement:*
* Decided to test the Markdown approach with a separate test page instead of directly modifying announcements.
* Added rich styling to better match the existing fantasy aesthetic.
* Improved the pattern to handle multiple content files through query parameters.
* Enhanced code blocks with magical styling to make them appear like arcane spells conjured by Machine Elves.

*Next Steps:*
* Test this system thoroughly to check for any rendering issues.
* Consider applying this pattern to the announcements system.
* Evaluate whether to extend to other content areas of the site.
