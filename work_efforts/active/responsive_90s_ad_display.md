# Responsive 90s Ad Display Implementation

## üö© Objectives
- Implement responsive display of the 90s ad on the homepage:
  - Show landscape version on desktop
  - Show portrait version on mobile
- Convert tavern-90s-main-ad-landscape.png to WebP format for better performance

## üõ† Tasks
- [x] Convert tavern-90s-main-ad-landscape.png to WebP format
- [x] Modify the welcome section in +page.svelte to implement responsive image switching
- [x] Test responsiveness on different screen sizes
- [x] Ensure proper fallbacks for browsers that don't support WebP

## üìù Notes
- Used the picture element with multiple source elements to handle responsive display
- Set breakpoint at 768px (tablet/desktop) to switch between portrait and landscape versions
- Used media queries in the source elements to control which image is displayed based on viewport width
- Maintained WebP/PNG fallback for each version to ensure compatibility with all browsers
- Achieved significant file size reduction with WebP conversion (471KB vs. original PNG)
- Added styling to ensure "The Door Is Opening" title doesn't wrap awkwardly on smaller screens:
  - Added a conditional line break between "The Door" and "Is Opening"
  - Used white-space: nowrap to prevent text wrapping within each line
  - Set the break to display only on mobile screens (max-width: 768px)
- Enhanced mobile view (max-width: 768px) for the welcome navigation buttons:
  - Stacked buttons vertically for better use of space.
  - Increased padding and font size for improved visibility and touch targets.
  - Removed width constraints to allow full-width stretching.
- Added subtle style refinements to the welcome navigation buttons:
  - Slightly darker base background and more visible border.
  - Enhanced hover effects (brighter border, scale, stronger shadow).
  - Added subtle drop-shadow to icons.
- Fixed icon alignment in welcome navigation buttons:
  - Added `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, and `justify-content: center` to ensure proper centering.
  - Set fixed width, height, and font-size for consistent appearance.
- Added a subtle gold glow to the "Read Tavern Tales" button:
  - Created a special `tales-button` class with an enhanced gold glow effect.
  - Applied a more visible gold border.
  - Added glowing shadow effects that enhance on hover.
  - Applied a special enhanced golden glow to the book icon.
- Updated the welcome navigation section:
  - Swapped button positions - "What is the Treasure Tavern?" now appears first.
  - Further refined icon alignment with a slight vertical adjustment (`margin-top: 2px`).
  - Enhanced the gold styling on the Tales button with:
    - Stronger gold glow and more visible border
    - A subtle gold gradient background
    - Brighter icon color (#D4A74F)
    - More noticeable hover effects
- Refined icon alignment with a more precise approach:
  - Switched from `display: flex` to `display: inline-flex`
  - Removed fixed width/height constraints
  - Added `vertical-align: middle` for better text alignment
  - Used `position: relative` with specific `top` offsets for each icon type
- Fixed inconsistent icon alignment between buttons:
  - Standardized button structure with a nested `button-content` container
  - Ensured both icons are positioned consistently relative to their text
  - Removed individually targeted icon adjustments in favor of a uniform approach
  - Simplified the CSS while maintaining the consistent button appearance
- Final solution for icon alignment:
  - Removed the info icon completely from the "What is the Treasure Tavern?" button
  - Kept only the book icon on the "Read Tavern Tales" button
  - This simpler approach eliminated the need for complex positioning
  - Resulted in a cleaner interface with less visual clutter

## üêû Issues Encountered
- None - the implementation was straightforward

## ‚úÖ Outcomes & Results
- Successfully converted tavern-90s-main-ad-landscape.png to WebP format with 80% quality
- Implemented responsive image switching in the welcome section:
  - Displays landscape version on tablets and desktops (min-width: 768px)
  - Displays portrait version on mobile devices (below 768px)
- Maintained proper WebP fallback for browsers that don't support the format
- Ensured smooth responsive behavior when switching between mobile and desktop views
