# Home Page Carousel Implementation

## Task
Add a responsive image carousel to the home page that rotates through promotional images and allows for user navigation.

## Requirements
1. Create a reusable image carousel component
2. Display promotional images for Treasure Tavern
3. Add automatic rotation with a 6-second interval
4. Implement navigation controls and indicators
5. Ensure the carousel is responsive and works well on all devices
6. Support both standard and WebP image formats

## Development Plan
1. Create a new ImageCarousel.svelte component in the lib/components directory
2. Implement image rotation functionality with configurable interval
3. Add navigation controls (next/previous buttons)
4. Add indicator dots for each slide
5. Implement touch/swipe support for mobile devices
6. Add accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes)
7. Add the carousel to the home page
8. Style the carousel to match the site's fantasy theme
9. Test the carousel on various devices and screen sizes

## Implementation Details
- The carousel will be built as a standalone Svelte component for reusability
- Props will include:
  - images: Array of image objects with src, webpSrc (optional), and alt text
  - autoplayInterval: Time between image transitions (default: 5000ms)
  - showControls: Boolean to toggle navigation arrows (default: true)
  - showIndicators: Boolean to toggle indicator dots (default: true)
  - aspectRatio: String to control the aspect ratio (default: "16:9")
  - height: Optional fixed height value
- Features:
  - Automatic WebP detection and fallback to standard formats
  - Smooth CSS transitions between slides
  - Pause autoplay when user interacts with controls
  - Resume autoplay after a period of inactivity
  - Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys)
  - Touch/swipe support for mobile devices
  - ARIA attributes for accessibility

## Progress
