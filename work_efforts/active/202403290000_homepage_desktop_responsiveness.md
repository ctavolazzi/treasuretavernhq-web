# Homepage Desktop Responsiveness Enhancement

## Feature Request
Improve the responsiveness and layout of the main home page (`src/routes/+page.svelte`) specifically for desktop screen sizes. Ensure that these changes do not negatively impact or alter the existing mobile layout.

## Development Plan
1.  **Analyze:** Review the current structure and CSS of `src/routes/+page.svelte` focusing on desktop breakpoints (e.g., `min-width: 769px`, `min-width: 1024px`, etc.).
2.  **Identify Issues:** Pinpoint specific elements, sections, or layout patterns that appear suboptimal on wider screens (e.g., excessive width, poor alignment, awkward spacing, text scaling issues).
3.  **Implement CSS Adjustments:**
    *   Use CSS media queries targeting appropriate `min-width` values.
    *   Adjust properties like `max-width`, `margin`, `padding`, `grid-template-columns`, `flex-basis`, `font-size`, etc., for desktop views.
    *   Ensure mobile styles remain unaffected by scoping desktop changes within media queries.
4.  **Test:** Verify the changes across various common desktop resolutions (e.g., 1280px, 1440px, 1920px widths) and ensure the mobile layout is unchanged.
5.  **Refine:** Make further adjustments based on testing results.

## Progress
- Initialized work effort.
- Analyzed existing CSS and structure of `src/routes/+page.svelte`.
- Identified need for wider container and adjusted section widths on large desktops.
- Implemented CSS changes within a `@media (min-width: 1200px)` query:
  - Increased `.container` `max-width` to `1100px`.
  - Adjusted `max-width` of key sections to match.
  - Increased `main` padding.
  - Adjusted spacing in `.vision-content`.
- **Refinement Pass:**
  - Reduced `.lantern-container` size in desktop media queries (160px @ 1024px, 150px @ 1200px).
  - Tightened `h1 .welcome-wrapper` line-height and adjusted margins/font-sizes for better desktop presentation.
- **Correction Pass:**
  - Identified and fixed issue where refinement CSS (@media queries) were incorrectly placed outside the `<style>` block.
  - Moved media queries inside `<style>` tags, resolving linter errors.
  - Verified final styles for lantern (100px @ 1024px, 80px @ 1200px) and title spacing (line-heights 0.95/0.9/0.85) are correctly applied.
- **CRITICAL FAILURE:**
  - A subsequent edit attempt intended to fix CSS structure resulted in the accidental deletion of a large portion of the file's CSS code (from approx. line 605 to EOF).
  - **Action Required:** User must revert `src/routes/+page.svelte` using local file history or Git to restore the deleted code.
- **Recovery & Refinement:**
  - User successfully reverted the file using `git restore`.
  - Carefully reapplied targeted CSS changes within existing media queries (768px, 1024px) and added a new media query (1200px) inside the `<style>` block.
  - Adjusted `h1` margins and `line-height` across desktop breakpoints.
  - Significantly reduced `.lantern-container` size across desktop breakpoints (100px @ 1024px, 80px @ 1200px).
  - Widened main container and adjusted section widths/spacing for >= 1200px.
- **Final Refinement (Extreme):**
  - Applied extreme reductions to title spacing (`line-height`, `h1` `margin-bottom`, `welcome-medium`/`small` `margin-bottom`) and lantern size (`width`/`height`) across desktop media queries (768px, 1024px, 1200px) after previous attempts failed to apply correctly or were insufficient.
- **FINAL FAILURE:**
  - Multiple subsequent attempts to correct misplaced CSS and apply tiny lantern sizes / carousel margins failed silently or did not apply correctly.
  - AI unable to reliably modify CSS via tooling for this task.
  - **Resolution:** User must manually apply the required CSS changes.

## Final Status
- **Failed.** AI tooling unable to correctly apply final CSS refinements after multiple attempts and silent failures. User must manually implement desired styles.
