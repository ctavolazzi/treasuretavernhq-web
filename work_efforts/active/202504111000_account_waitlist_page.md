# Account Creation Waitlist Page Implementation

## üö© Objectives
- Create a waitlist page for upcoming account creation feature
- Update the About page to link to the new waitlist page
- Ensure the waitlist form collects and stores user information properly
- Implement Supabase integration for data storage
- Handle form submissions and provide appropriate feedback
- Add navigation access across the site for the waitlist page

## üõ† Tasks
- [x] Create a new route for the waitlist page (`/waitlist`)
- [x] Design a visually appealing waitlist page that fits the site's theme
- [x] Implement a waitlist form to collect user names and emails
- [x] Add server-side form handling
- [x] Integrate with Supabase to store waitlist entries
- [x] Handle duplicate email submissions gracefully
- [x] Create successful submission feedback
- [x] Handle error states appropriately
- [x] Update the About page with a link to the waitlist page
- [x] Style the waitlist button on the About page
- [x] Add informative text about account creation being in development
- [x] Add "Create Account" link to the main navigation menu
- [x] Add "Create Account" link to the mobile navigation menu
- [x] Add "Create Account" link to the footer navigation
- [x] Style the navigation links distinctively to highlight the feature

## üìù Notes
- The waitlist page allows users to sign up to be notified when account creation becomes available
- Using Supabase's 'account_creation_waitlist' table to store user information:
  - Email (primary identifier)
  - Name (optional)
  - Created timestamp
- Implemented validation for required fields before submission
- Added special handling for duplicate email submissions (shows success message)
- The design follows the same fantasy theme as the rest of the site
- Added appropriate breadcrumb navigation for the waitlist page
- The About page now has two CTA buttons: newsletter subscription and waitlist signup
- The waitlist button is styled with gold gradient to distinguish it from the newsletter button
- Made the "Create Account" navigation link visually distinctive:
  - Desktop: Gold text with border and icon
  - Mobile: Special styling with divider and icon
  - Footer: Standard link styling

## üêû Potential Issues
- Requires proper Supabase connection configuration to function
- May need to add protection against spam submissions in the future (e.g., CAPTCHA)
- Currently handling duplicates by showing success message - could add more specific messaging
- Email notifications will need to be set up separately when account creation is ready
- Navigation link says "Create Account" but actually leads to a waitlist - this might cause some confusion

  - Responsive design matching site theme
