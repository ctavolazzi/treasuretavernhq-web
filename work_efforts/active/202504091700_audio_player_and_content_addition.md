# Audio Player and Content Addition

## üö© Objectives
- Add background music to the home page that plays on page load
- Add a new "Tavern Atmosphere" section at the bottom of the page before the footer
- Create audio controls that allow users to mute/unmute the music

## üõ† Tasks
- [x] Add audio element for TheTavernOak.mp3
- [x] Implement audio controls with mute/unmute functionality
- [x] Add Font Awesome icons for the audio controls
- [x] Create a new "Tavern Atmosphere" section with thematic content
- [x] Style all new elements to match the site's fantasy theme
- [x] Test audio playback and controls across different browsers

## üìù Notes
- The audio file is located at `/static/audio/TheTavernOak.mp3`
- Added an audio element with proper loop and preload attributes
- Set the audio to play automatically when the page loads
- Implemented multiple fallback strategies to ensure audio autoplay works across different browsers:
  - Immediate play attempt on page load
  - Delayed play attempt after a short timeout
  - Play on first user interaction with the page
- Created a fixed audio control panel in the bottom right corner with mute/unmute functionality
- Styled the audio controls to match the site's fantasy theme with a semi-transparent background
- Added a new "Tavern Whispers" section at the bottom of the page with thematic content:
  - An atmospheric quote from a fictional tavern chronicler
  - Description of the tavern's ambiance that ties into the audio element
  - Animated musical notes that add visual interest
- Used Font Awesome icons for the audio controls (volume-mute and volume-up)
- Added volume control to set audio at 30% for better user experience
- Ensured audio stops properly on component unmount
- Implemented improved scroll detection to prevent audio controls from overlapping with the footer:
  - Added direct DOM querying of the footer on each scroll event
  - Added window resize event handling to recalculate positions
  - Increased timeout for initial position calculation

## üêû Issues Encountered
- Initially had a linter error when adding a second script tag for Font Awesome
- Resolved by moving the Font Awesome initialization to the existing onMount function
- First implementation of footer overlap prevention wasn't working correctly
- Fixed with a more robust approach that directly queries the footer element on each scroll

## ‚úÖ Outcomes & Results
- Successfully added TheTavernOak.mp3 as background music that plays automatically on page load
- Implemented robust autoplay with multiple fallback strategies to overcome browser restrictions
- Made the entire audio control panel clickable for better user experience
- Created an atmospheric "Tavern Whispers" section that enhances the thematic experience
- Added animated musical notes to create visual interest
- Ensured all new elements match the site's fantasy aesthetic
- Fixed all linter errors for proper functioning
- Implemented a more reliable solution to prevent audio controls from overlapping with the footer:
  - Controls now automatically reposition when the footer comes into view
  - Position updates on both scroll and window resize events
  - More reliable DOM querying approach
