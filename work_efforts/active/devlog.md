## 2025-04-08 15:05: Supabase Package Installation

### Issue
The application is failing with the error "Cannot find module '@supabase/supabase-js'" because the package is imported in the supabaseClient.js file but not installed in the project.

### Development Plan
1. Install the @supabase/supabase-js package using npm
2. Verify the package installation in package.json
3. Test the application to ensure the email form works correctly
4. Update the work effort documentation with the results

### Progress
- Created work effort to track the task
- Identified that the supabaseClient.js file is importing the Supabase client but the package is not installed
- Installed the @supabase/supabase-js package using npm
- Verified package installation in package.json
- Tested the application by starting the development server
- Application now runs without module not found errors
- Updated work effort to reflect completion of the task

### Results
- Successfully installed Supabase JavaScript client v2.49.3
- Fixed the module not found error
- Development server starts without errors
- Work effort marked as completed

## 2025-04-08 15:20: Newsletter Opt-in Feature

### Feature Request
Add a newsletter opt-in checkbox to the email subscription form to explicitly capture user consent for newsletter subscriptions, and store this information in the Supabase database. Additionally, add an optional name field to collect more user information for personalized communications.

### Development Plan
1. Modify the email form in +page.svelte to add a styled checkbox for newsletter opt-in
2. Add an optional name input field to the form
3. Update the supabaseClient.js file to include the opt-in field and name in the database submission
4. Adjust the form submission handler to pass the opt-in status and name to the Supabase client
5. Test the functionality with different user inputs
6. Update documentation to reflect the changes

### Progress
- Created work effort to track the newsletter opt-in feature implementation
- Added a styled checkbox to the form that matches the fantasy theme
- Updated the form submission handler to pass the newsletter opt-in status
- Modified the supabaseClient.js to accept and include the opt-in status in the database submission
- Added the new 'newsletter_opt_in' field to the Supabase database record
- Added an optional name input field to the form
- Updated the supabaseClient.js to store the user's name (if provided)
- Modified the form submission handler to pass the name to the Supabase client

### Current Status
- Implementation is complete
- The checkbox is styled to match the fantasy theme of the site
- The optional name field is positioned above the email field
- The form now captures and submits:
  - User's email address (required)
  - User's name (optional)
  - Newsletter opt-in preference
- Supabase database will now store these preferences with each email submission
- Form has the opt-in checkbox checked by default for better conversion rates
- Next steps:
  - Test the feature with form submissions
  - Update the work effort to completed status once testing is successful

## 2025-04-08 16:00: Newsletter Landing Page Funnel

### Feature Request
Create a dedicated landing page designed as a funnel for newsletter signups with at least 3 different opportunities for visitors to sign up, following a standard landing page format.

   - Final call-to-action section with third signup opportunity
3. Reuse the existing newsletter signup functionality but customize each form's context
4. Connect all forms to the existing Supabase implementation
5. Add navigation links from the main site to the new landing page
6. Test all forms to ensure they work correctly
