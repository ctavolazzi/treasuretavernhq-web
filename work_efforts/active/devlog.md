## 2025-04-12 19:00: Fixed Load More Button Functionality in Announcements Page

### Issue
The "Load More Announcements" button on the announcements page wasn't working properly. Clicking the button didn't display additional announcements.

### Development Plan
1. Analyze the current implementation to identify the issue
2. Fix the reactivity issues with the button functionality
3. Test the solution to ensure it works correctly

### Progress
- Identified the issue: The reactive update for visibleAnnouncements wasn't properly triggered when displayCount changed

## 2025-03-27

### 15:45 - Audio Controls: Simplified by Removing LocalStorage Persistence

Further simplified the audio controls:

1. Removed localStorage getting/setting for the audio mute state
2. Ensured audio always starts muted on every page load
3. Made it a simple toggle without preserving user preferences between sessions
4. Cleaned up related conditional code for better maintainability

This change makes the audio control behavior more predictable - it will always start muted when the page loads, and users can toggle it on if desired. The mute setting will reset when the page is refreshed, simplifying the user experience.

### 15:40 - Lantern Animation: Simplified to Two-Image Flickering

Updated the lantern animation to use only two specific images:

1. Modified the animation to alternate strictly between tavern-lantern-2.webp and tavern-lantern.webp
2. Simplified the frame sequence while maintaining variable timing for natural-looking flicker
3. Reduced the total number of frames from 16 to 10 for a more focused animation
4. Maintained the same high-quality dithering and color settings
5. Kept the success animation unchanged

This change simplifies the animation while still providing an engaging flickering effect. The new animation focuses on the primary flickering states, creating a cleaner visual that maintains the lantern's atmospheric quality.

### 15:30 - Audio Controls: Removed Pulsing Animation

Removed the attention-grabbing pulsing animation from the audio controls:

1. Eliminated the setTimeout that was adding the "attention-pulse" class
2. Removed the CSS animation code for the pulsing effect
3. Verified that the audio player still starts muted by default as required

This change provides a cleaner, less distracting UI while maintaining the audio control functionality. The audio controls no longer pulse or flash to draw attention, resulting in a more subtle and polished user experience.

### 15:20 - Lantern Animation: Enhanced with Natural Random Flickering

Further improved the lantern animation with more natural flickering effects:

1. Increased the number of frames from 8 to 16 for more animation variety
2. Added variable timing for each frame (between 0.08s and 0.17s) for a less predictable effect
3. Incorporated the third lantern image for additional visual depth
4. Improved dithering and color settings for smoother transitions
5. Created a more varied, random sequence to better simulate a real flame

These improvements make the lantern animation look more realistic and engaging, with a natural flickering effect that better captures the atmosphere of a flame. The enhanced animation maintains the same visual theme while providing a more dynamic user experience.

### 15:10 - Lantern Animation: Created Dedicated GIFs Folder and Improved Animation

Organized the project structure by creating a dedicated folder for GIF assets and improved the animation style:

1. Created a new `static/gifs/` directory to store all GIF animations
2. Moved the lantern animation GIFs to this new directory
3. Updated the script to output to the new location
4. Modified the code to reference the new paths
5. Changed the animation to use continuous flickering instead of turning on and off

This organization improves the project structure and makes it easier to manage different types of media assets. The lantern animation now uses GIFs for both the normal flickering animation and the success state, which simplifies the code and reduces JavaScript overhead. The continuous flickering between lit and sparking states creates a more engaging visual effect.

### 14:30 - New Work Effort: Lantern Animation to GIF Conversion

Created a new work effort to convert the current JavaScript-based lantern animation to a simpler GIF animation. The plan is to:

1. Create a GIF animation from existing lantern images
2. Replace the current JavaScript-based animation with the GIF
3. Maintain the success state after subscription
4. Simplify the related JavaScript code

This change should improve performance by reducing JavaScript overhead while maintaining the visual appeal of the animation. The animation will play automatically when the page loads, improving the user experience.

### Development Plan
1. Examine the current tavern-song-scroll.png image to identify the background color/pattern
2. Create a script using ffmpeg to remove the background via chroma keying or similar technique
3. Save the processed image with transparency in PNG format

## 2025-04-13 00:30 - Dynamic Bottom Navigation Component Implementation

### Component Implementation
Successfully implemented the BottomNav.svelte component with the following features:
- Expandable interface with "+" button that transforms when clicked
- Speech bubble style menu with customizable options
- Music controls integration
- Smart footer detection to prevent overlap
- Fully responsive design for both desktop and mobile

### Key Implementation Details:
1. **Structure and Styling**
   - Created a fixed-position container that sits at the bottom of the viewport
   - Implemented a circular expand/collapse button with gold accent color
   - Added a speech bubble style menu with a pointer to the button
   - Used CSS animations for smooth expansion and collapse

2. **Functionality**
   - Used Svelte's reactive statements to handle state changes
   - Implemented click-outside detection to close the menu when clicking elsewhere
   - Connected music controls to the audio player functionality
   - Added scroll event handling to detect footer proximity

3. **Footer Compatibility**
   - Implemented a solution to prevent the bottom nav from overlapping the footer
   - The nav adjusts its position when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page
   - Used DOM querying to detect the footer's position in real-time

4. **Customization**
   - Made the component fully customizable through props:
     - Custom navigation options
     - Toggle for music controls
     - Custom audio source and title

### Demo Page
Created a demonstration page at `/bottom-nav-demo` that showcases all the component features and allows testing of:
- Music control options
- Navigation functionality
- Footer detection
- Responsive behavior

The component is now ready for integration into the main site layout or individual pages as needed.

## 2025-04-13 01:30 - Bottom Nav Layout Integration

### Integration with Layout
The Bottom Navigation component has been successfully integrated into the site's main layout:

- Added the BottomNav component to the layout file, making it available on all pages
- Created an audio store to manage page-specific audio settings
- Implemented a system for individual pages to set their own custom audio
- Ensured proper coordination with the footer to prevent overlap

### Audio Store Implementation
To allow different pages to set their own audio for the bottom nav, I created a Svelte store:

- Created `audioStore.ts` with a writable store for audio settings
- Implemented functions to set, reset, and disable page audio
- Set up default audio settings to be used when not overridden
- Added conditional rendering in the layout to show/hide the bottom nav

### Page-Specific Integration
Added an example implementation to the Tavern Tales page:

- Used `setPageAudio()` in the `onMount` function to set custom audio
- Added `resetPageAudio()` in the `onDestroy` function to restore default audio when leaving
- This pattern can be used on any page that needs custom audio settings

The integration is now complete, and the Bottom Navigation component is ready for use across the site. Pages can opt into custom audio settings or use the default audio, and the component will handle all the necessary positioning adjustments with the footer.

## 2025-04-13 02:00 - Bottom Nav Design Enhancement

### Design Improvements
Based on user feedback and the inspiration image, I've completely redesigned the bottom navigation component to be more elegant and visually appealing:

- **Improved the speech bubble design**:
  - Better pointed at the center of the button
  - Enhanced shadow effects for depth
  - Added subtle separators between menu options
- **Enhanced button styling**:
  - Larger, more prominent gold button
  - Better shadow effects for a premium look
  - Smoother hover transitions
- **Refined typography and spacing**:
  - More elegant font sizes and spacing

- Removed the floating audio controls from the home page
- Removed the `FloatingAudioPlayer` component from the Bone Kingdom tale page
- Fixed all linter errors related to audio player references
- Set up the Bone Kingdom tale to use the bottom nav for audio playback instead

### Audio Playback Improvements
Enhanced the bottom navigation component's audio handling:

- Fixed issues with the music controls to ensure proper playback
- Added custom event dispatching for audio state changes
- Ensured the audio is not muted by default when source changes
- Created a test page at `/bottom-nav-test` to verify audio functionality

### Consolidated Audio Control
Now all audio playback across the site is centralized through the bottom navigation component:

- Individual pages can set their own custom audio via the audio store
- Audio state is managed consistently across all pages
- Navigation between pages maintains audio state appropriately
- The UX is improved with a single, consistent interface for controlling audio

These changes have simplified the codebase, removed redundant functionality, and created a more cohesive user experience for audio playback throughout the site.
