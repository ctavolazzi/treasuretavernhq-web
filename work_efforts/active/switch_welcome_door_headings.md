# Switch Welcome and Door Opening Text Elements

## 🚩 Objectives
- Switch the positions of "Welcome to the Treasure Tavern" and "The Door is Opening" text elements on the home page
- Add context text under "The Door Is Opening" heading explaining what Treasure Tavern actually is
- Apply different sizes to each line of the "Welcome to Treasure Tavern" h1 heading

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Locate the two text elements in the home page component
- [x] Switch their positions while maintaining their respective stylings
- [x] Add explanatory text under "The Door Is Opening" heading about what Treasure Tavern is
- [x] Format the h1 heading with multiple lines and different sizes
- [x] Test the changes to ensure proper display on different screen sizes
- [x] Update the work effort with the results

## 📝 Notes
- "The Door is Opening" is currently the main h1 heading at the top of the page
- "Welcome to Treasure Tavern" is an h2 heading in the welcome section
- Need to maintain appropriate styling for each heading when switching their positions

## 🐞 Potential Issues
- May need to adjust styling to maintain visual hierarchy when switching positions
- Need to ensure responsive behavior is maintained after the change

## ✅ Progress
- Created work effort to track the task of switching text elements on the home page
- Located both text elements in src/routes/+page.svelte:
  - "The Door is Opening" was the main h1 heading at the top of the page
  - "Welcome to Treasure Tavern" was an h2 heading in the welcome section
- Successfully swapped the text content while maintaining their respective heading elements:
  - "Welcome to Treasure Tavern" is now the main h1 heading at the top of the page
  - "The Door is Opening" is now the h2 heading in the welcome section
- Added a descriptive paragraph below "The Door Is Opening" heading that explains what Treasure Tavern is:
  - Described it as a fantasy universe created for entertainment and escape
  - Noted its multiple facets: fiction, online store, interactive social media experience, etc.
- Modified the format of the h1 heading:
  - Split "Welcome to Treasure Tavern" across four lines
  - Applied different sizes to each line as requested (medium, small, large, large)
  - Used span elements with appropriate CSS classes for styling
- Verified that the styling and hierarchy are preserved
- All tasks completed successfully
