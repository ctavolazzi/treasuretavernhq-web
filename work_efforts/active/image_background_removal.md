# Remove Background from Tavern Song Scroll Image

## 🚩 Objectives
- Remove the background from the tavern-song-scroll.png image using ffmpeg
- Create a transparent version of the image for use in the website
- Maintain image quality while removing the background

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Examine the current tavern-song-scroll.png image
- [x] Create a script to remove the background using ffmpeg
- [x] Save the processed image with transparency in appropriate format (PNG)
- [x] Test the image across different backgrounds to ensure proper transparency
- [x] Optimize the image for web use if needed

## 📝 Notes
- The image is located at `/static/images/tavern-song-scroll.png`
- There's existing experience with ffmpeg in the codebase (see lantern GIF creation script)
- Used ffmpeg's colorkey filter for background removal
- PNG format was used to maintain transparency
- The processed image maintains the same dimensions as the original
- Created a script at `/scripts/remove-background.sh` that can be reused for similar tasks
- Utilized medium gray color (0x666666) as the key color with similarity of 0.4 and blend of 0.2 for optimal results

## 🐞 Potential Issues
- Background might have some inconsistency in color, leading to some areas not being fully transparent
- Edge artifacts may appear around the scroll
- If further refinement is needed, consider adjusting the similarity and blend parameters in the script

## ✅ Progress
- Created work effort to track the background removal task
- Identified the image location at /static/images/tavern-song-scroll.png
- Researched existing ffmpeg usage in the codebase for reference
- Created a script (`remove-background.sh`) to handle the background removal
- Used ffmpeg's colorkey filter with appropriate parameters
- Generated the transparent PNG file at /static/images/tavern-song-scroll-transparent.png
- Verified that the output image has an alpha channel
