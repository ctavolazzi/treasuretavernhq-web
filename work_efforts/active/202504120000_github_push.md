# GitHub Push Work Effort

## Feature Request
Push the most recent changes to the GitHub repository to keep the remote repository in sync with the local development environment.

## Development Plan
1. Check the current git status to identify modified files
2. Review the changes in the modified files
3. Add the changes to the staging area
4. Create a commit with a descriptive message summarizing the changes
5. Push the changes to the GitHub remote repository
6. Verify the push was successful

## Progress

- Identified the following modified files:
  - src/routes/+page.svelte
  - src/routes/tavern-tales/[slug]/+page.svelte
- These files contain updates related to site improvements and functionality
