# GitHub Push Work Effort

## Feature Request
Push the most recent changes to the GitHub repository to keep the remote repository in sync with the local development environment.

## Development Plan
1. Check the current git status to identify modified files
2. Review the changes in the modified files
3. Add the changes to the staging area
4. Create a commit with a descriptive message summarizing the changes
5. Push the changes to the GitHub remote repository
6. Verify the push was successful

## Progress
- Created work effort to track the GitHub push process
- Identified the following modified files:
  - src/routes/+page.svelte
  - src/routes/tavern-tales/[slug]/+page.svelte
- These files contain updates related to site improvements and functionality
- Added the modified files to the git staging area using `git add`
- Created a commit with the message "Update main page and tale page, document GitHub push process"
- Successfully pushed the changes to the GitHub repository with `git push origin main`
- Verified that the local branch is now in sync with the remote repository

## Results
- Successfully pushed all changes to the GitHub repository
- Work effort documentation (devlog and this file) created to track the process
- The commit (6c0a9a2) has been pushed to the main branch
- The repository is now up to date with all local changes
- Status: Completed
