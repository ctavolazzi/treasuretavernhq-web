# Lantern Animation to GIF Conversion

## 🚩 Objectives
- Convert the current JavaScript-based lantern animation to a simpler GIF animation
- Improve page performance by reducing JavaScript overhead
- Maintain visual appeal and theme of the existing animation
- Support the success state after subscription

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Create a GIF animation from the existing lantern images
- [x] Create a script to generate the GIFs using ffmpeg
- [x] Create a dedicated folder structure for GIFs
- [x] Update the script to use the new folder structure
- [x] Update the code to reference GIFs from the new location
- [x] Test the animation across different devices and browsers

## 📝 Notes
- Current animation uses three image states: out (unlit), sparking, and lit
- Animation is triggered on hover/touch and after successful subscription
- Need to maintain the "success" state for after subscription
- Used ffmpeg to create two GIFs: one for flickering animation and one for the success state
- Created a bash script in scripts/ directory to generate the GIFs
- Created a dedicated folder at static/gifs for better organization of GIF assets
- Updated animation to use continuous flickering between lit and sparking states
- Modified the animation to flicker between only two specific states: tavern-lantern-2.webp and tavern-lantern.webp
- Removed pulsing/flashing animation from audio controls as requested
- Removed localStorage functionality for audio mute state - it now always starts muted and is a simple toggle

## 🐞 Potential Issues
- GIF quality vs. file size tradeoff
- Limited control over animation timing compared to JavaScript
- Ensuring smooth transitions between animation states
- Maintaining hover state interactivity with GIF

## ✅ Progress
- Created `create-lantern-gifs.sh` script that uses ffmpeg to generate the GIFs
- Successfully generated two GIFs:
  - `tavern-lantern-animation.gif`: Simplified flickering between two specific images (tavern-lantern-2.webp and tavern-lantern.webp)
  - `tavern-lantern-success.gif`: Gentle pulsing animation for success state
- Created a dedicated folder at static/gifs to store the generated GIFs
- Updated code to use these GIFs instead of the JavaScript animation
- Simplified event handlers while maintaining interactivity
- Updated the animation to use only two specific lantern images for a more focused flickering effect
- Removed the attention-pulse animation from audio controls for a cleaner UI
- Ensured audio player always starts muted by default
- Simplified audio controls by removing localStorage persistence - mute state now resets on page refresh
