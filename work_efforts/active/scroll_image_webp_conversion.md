# Convert Scroll Image to WebP Format

## 🚩 Objectives
- Convert the transparent PNG scroll image to WebP format
- Maintain transparency in the WebP version
- Optimize file size while preserving image quality
- Update references in the codebase to use the WebP version with PNG fallback

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Examine the current transparent PNG scroll image
- [x] Create a script to convert the image to WebP format with transparency
- [x] Ensure the WebP image maintains proper transparency
- [x] Implement PNG fallback for browsers that don't support WebP
- [x] Update the image reference in the home page component
- [x] Test the image display across different browsers and devices

## 📝 Notes
- The source image is located at `/static/images/tavern-song-scroll-transparent.png`
- WebP format supports alpha transparency similar to PNG
- Need to add browser compatibility checks similar to what's used for the lantern images
- Will create a dedicated conversion script that can be reused for other images
- The script has been created at `/utils/scripts/png-to-webp.sh`
- The conversion achieved an 85% file size reduction (from 4.0MB to 576KB)
- Implementation uses the picture tag with source and img elements for maximum compatibility

## 🐞 Potential Issues
- Some older browsers don't support WebP format, requiring a PNG fallback
- Need to ensure the alpha channel is properly preserved during conversion
- File size optimization should not significantly reduce image quality

## ✅ Progress
- Created work effort to track the WebP conversion task
- Identified the source image at /static/images/tavern-song-scroll-transparent.png
- Researched WebP support for transparency
- Created a script at `/utils/scripts/png-to-webp.sh` to handle the WebP conversion
- Ensured the script preserves transparency in the WebP output
- Successfully converted the PNG to WebP format with transparency preserved
- Achieved an 85% file size reduction (from 4.0MB to 576KB)
- Updated the home page to include WebP with PNG fallback using the picture tag
- Added conditional rendering in the ImageModal component based on browser support
- Verified that the transparency is properly maintained in the WebP version
- Work effort completed successfully
