# Testing Markdown with Images

This is a test page to verify that our Markdown rendering system works correctly, especially with images.

## Machine Elves Content

The Machine Elves are fascinating interdimensional beings who work in our kitchen. They have unique requirements and recently went on strike.

Their strike demands included:

- Chronologically flexible lunch breaks
- Interdimensional vacation days
- Healthcare for appendages that may or may not exist
- A dedicated meditation space

After negotiations, they returned to work in the interdimensional kitchen, creating dishes that technically don't exist in our reality.

## Text Formatting Tests

This paragraph contains **bold text** and _italic text_. It also has `inline code` formatting.

```javascript
// This is a code block
function testFunction() {
  return 'Hello, Markdown!';
}
```

> This is a blockquote that tests how quotations are rendered in our Markdown system.

## Mystical Code Examples

The Machine Elves use complex arcane invocations to manipulate reality itself. Here's a glimpse of their ethereal code:

```javascript
// Summoning a portal to the interdimensional kitchen
function summonPortal(location, timePhase) {
  const portalEnergy = calculateEtherealResonance(location);
  let stabilityMatrix = [];

  // The five elements of reality
  const elements = ['aether', 'chronos', 'void', 'light', 'consciousness'];

  // Create stability matrix for non-linear time passage
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    stabilityMatrix.push(alignDimensionalThreads(elements[i], timePhase));
  }

  return new Portal({
    destination: location,
    stability: stabilityMatrix.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0) / 5,
    duration: timePhase === 'eternal' ? Infinity : 60 * 60 * 1000,
    sideEffects: ['mild reality distortion', 'temporal echoes', 'remembered futures']
  });
}

// Call upon the Machine Elves to prepare the meal
const kitchenPortal = summonPortal('interdimensional-kitchen', 'flexible-lunch');
const elfCrew = Machine.Elves.assign(kitchenPortal, 12);

elfCrew.prepareGastronomicExperience('Hypercube Honeycakes');
```

The previous code allows reality-bending cuisine to be prepared across multiple timelines simultaneously.

Here's how they synchronize their interdimensional schedules:

```python
# Machine Elf Time Synchronization Protocol
class TimeThread:
    def __init__(self, base_reality, flux_coefficient=0.782):
        self.reality = base_reality
        self.flux = flux_coefficient
        self.anchor_points = []

    def add_anchor_point(self, event, importance):
        """Anchor a moment across all realities to ensure synchronization"""
        if importance > 0.9:  # High importance events create stronger anchors
            # Notify all Machine Elves across dimensions
            for dimension in KNOWN_DIMENSIONS:
                signal = EtherealSignal(event, self.reality, dimension)
                signal.propagate(strength=importance)

        self.anchor_points.append({
            "event": event,
            "importance": importance,
            "reality_state": self.reality.current_state()
        })

        return len(self.anchor_points)

# Main scheduling system
vacation_scheduler = TimeThread("kitchen-prime", flux_coefficient=1.234)

# Schedule interdimensional vacation days
vacation_scheduler.add_anchor_point("Group Meditation in Void Space", 0.95)
vacation_scheduler.add_anchor_point("Lunch Break at Beginning of Time", 0.87)
vacation_scheduler.add_anchor_point("Staff Meeting Across All Possible Realities", 0.99)
```

And of course, the Machine Elves' healthcare system for managing appendages across realities:

```rust
/// Appendage Management System for Non-Euclidean Beings
struct AppendageState {
    exists: Option<bool>,  // May or may not exist
    dimensions: Vec<String>,  // Which dimensions it exists in
    phase: f32,  // Current phase of the moon (0.0 - 1.0)
    probability: f32,  // Quantum probability of manifestation
}

impl MachineElf {
    // Register appendages that may or may not exist
    fn register_quantum_appendage(&mut self, name: &str, base_probability: f32) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // Calculate the current lunar influence
        let moon_phase = calculate_current_moon_phase();
        let manifestation_threshold = if moon_phase < 0.2 || moon_phase > 0.8 {
            0.7  // More appendages manifest during new/full moons
        } else {
            0.4  // Fewer appendages during quarter moons
        };

        // Determine which dimensions this appendage exists in
        let existing_dimensions = REALITY_MATRIX
            .iter()
            .filter(|dim| dim.probability > manifestation_threshold)
            .map(|dim| dim.name.clone())
            .collect();

        self.appendages.insert(name.to_string(), AppendageState {
            exists: None,  // Superposition until observed
            dimensions: existing_dimensions,
            phase: moon_phase,
            probability: base_probability * moon_influence(moon_phase),
        });

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

These arcane code samples are just a small glimpse into the complex reality-manipulation techniques employed by our interdimensional staff.
