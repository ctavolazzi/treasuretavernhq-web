# Machine Elves Strike Resolved

The labor dispute with our Machine Elves kitchen staff has finally been settled. Their demands for 'chronologically flexible lunch breaks' and 'interdimensional vacation days' have been accommodated. Patrons may notice our menu now includes several dishes that technically don't exist on this plane of reality.

## Meet the Machine Elves

For those unfamiliar with Machine Elves, they are extradimensional beings who exist simultaneously across multiple realities. We hired a group of them last fall after our previous head chef was accidentally trapped in the Ethereal Plane during an unfortunate incident involving a mislabeled portal scroll and a wheel of enchanted cheese.

## The Strike

The strike began three weeks ago (or possibly three centuries ago, depending on which timeline you're following) when the head Machine Elf, Who-Sings-In-Geometric-Patterns, discovered that our standard employee benefits package did not account for the fact that Machine Elves experience time non-linearly.

## Their Demands

Specifically, they demanded:

- The right to take lunch breaks in the past, present, or future
- Vacation days that could be taken in parallel universes
- Healthcare coverage for appendages that may or may not exist depending on the phase of the moon
- A dedicated meditation space where the laws of physics are "more like guidelines"

## Resolution

After consulting with our interdimensional labor relations expert (a former bureaucrat from the Time Variance Authority), we've restructured our employment contracts to accommodate these unique needs.

## New Menu Items

As a result, our menu has been expanded to include several exciting new offerings, including:

- **Schrödinger's Stew** - simultaneously the best and worst stew you've ever tasted until you observe it
- **Hypercube Honeycakes** - which are bigger on the inside
- **Möbius Strip Pasta** - which you can keep twirling on your fork indefinitely

## The Dining Experience

Please note that some dishes may arrive before you order them, and others might temporarily vanish from existence. Our waitstaff has been trained to handle these temporal anomalies, and we assure you that all food is perfectly safe for consumption by beings limited to experiencing time in a linear fashion.

In their meditation space, the Machine Elves recharge their interdimensional energies, allowing them to continue producing the most extraordinary culinary experiences in the realm.

## Dining Recommendations

For the most authentic experience, we recommend reservations during our "Reality Flux" hours (6-8 PM on Thursdays), when the interdimensional barriers are thinnest and the Machine Elves' powers are at their peak. During this time, diners may experience:

- Flavors that trigger memories you haven't formed yet
- Meals that change presentation each time you blink
- Conversations with alternate versions of yourself from parallel realities
- Dining companions who may temporarily become two-dimensional

We hope you'll join us soon to experience the wonders of interdimensional cuisine, now available daily thanks to our successful resolution of the Machine Elves strike.
